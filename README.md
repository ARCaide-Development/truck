# `truck` â€’ A Rust CAD Kernel

`truck` is an open-source [B-rep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation)
[geometric modeling kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_modeling_kernel)
written in Rust.

*This bottle is based on [this tutorial](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt__tutorial.html)
by Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT), a great senior of truck.
The OCCT tutorial properly models the fillets and the threading.
This shows that truck is still in its infancy in terms of functionality.
Our immediate goal for truck is to be able to model this bottle perfectly.*

## Overview

The guiding principles are:

### Modern Tools

- We are using Rust. We pay special attention to make everything work with
  WebGPU (`wgpu`).
- We use Cargo's extensive maintenance features to ensure thorough continuous
  integration.

### Mindful Choices

- Instead of creating another binding to one of the existing geometry kernels
  we are writing a new B-rep NURBS kernel.
- We use safe Rust (although we give you the choice of using `unsafe` methods
  in some instances).
- Speed is a priority and that includes the `wgpu` backend.

### Modular Architecture

- Functionality is modularized into smaller crates that can be replaced, like
  the parts in [the Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus).
- Based on the many lessons we learned in the past, we have given up on overall
  optimizations that a single library/crate would afford. A collection of
  individual, optimized crates carries less risk and can be made just as
  efficient.
- Feature creep usually happens over time. While we don't believe to be immune
  from it, bundling stuff in smaller crates will help us deal with it.

## Usage

### Examples

All examples are located under the `examples` folder of each crate.
These examples use the default syntax for running examples, as found in the
[resp. Cargo documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#examples) .

At first, let's run the following example!

```bash
git submodule update --init
cargo run --example rotate-objects
```
