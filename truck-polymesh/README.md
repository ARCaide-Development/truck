# truck-polymesh

`truck_polymesh`: define polyline-polygon data structure and some algorithms handling mesh.

## Warning
This crate is WIP, despite the fact that it is used extensively in the sample code.
Specifically, member variables of `PolygonMesh` can be hidden at any time.
`MeshHandler`, which is hidden in the documentation, may be deprecated and
mesh handling may be done as a trait implemented to `PolygonMesh`.
We will move up one minor version when we make these changes.
