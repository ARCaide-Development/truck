Integrated modeling algorithms by geometry and topology
## Dependencies
The dev-dependencies of this crate includes [CMake](https://cmake.org).

# Sample Codes
## bottle
Modeling a bottle.

This is a technical indicator for comparing with Open CASCADE Technology, a great senior.
We want to reproduce the bottle made in the [OCCT tutorial].
Now, one cannot make a fillet or run boolean operations by truck.
So, the bottle made by this script is not completed.

[OCCT tutorial]: https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt__tutorial.html
## cube
Modeling a unit cube by three sweeps.
## punched-cube
Modeling a unit cube with a hole through it.
## torus
Modeling a torus by two sweeps.
## tsudumi
Modeling a one-leaf hyperboloid.
